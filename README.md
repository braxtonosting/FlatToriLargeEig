## Overview

This site contains supporting material for our paper, *Flat tori with large Laplacian eigenvalues in dimensions up to eight*. 

* `checkSVP.txt` is a file containing [Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) code that supports Numerical Observation 1.2
* `GoodGramSage.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook with [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) code used to symbolically verify Numerical Observation 4.2. This code uses functions defined in `GoodGram.py`.
